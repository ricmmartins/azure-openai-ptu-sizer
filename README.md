# Azure OpenAI PTU Sizer

A practical toolkit to help Azure OpenAI users estimate Provisioned Throughput Units (PTUs), identify token usage patterns, and compare cost strategies.

## üîç Overview
This repo includes:

- üìä **Azure Workbook** to visualize token usage and estimate PTUs
- üìà **Excel-based PTU Calculator** for cost comparison and scenario modeling
- üß© **Workbook-to-Spreadsheet Mapping** to streamline the workflow
- üß™ **Example workflow** to get you started in under 10 minutes

---

## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Clone or Download
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ricmmartins/azure-openai-ptu-sizer.git
cd azure-openai-ptu-sizer
```

### 2. Open the Workbook
Import the [Azure Workbook JSON](./workbook/ptu-usage-tracker-workbook.json) into your Azure Portal:

1. Go to **Azure Portal > Monitor > Workbooks**
2. Click **New > Advanced Editor**
3. Paste the contents of the workbook JSON
4. Update the data source with your **Log Analytics Workspace ID**

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è No customization needed beyond selecting the right workspace.

### 3. Use the Spreadsheet
Open the [PTU_Sizing_Recommendation_Enhanced.xlsx](./spreadsheet/PTU_Sizing_Recommendation_Enhanced.xlsx) file. Update the highlighted **input cells only**:

- **B4**: PTU Price per 1M Tokens (Reserved)
- **B5**: Monthly Minutes (usually 43,800)
- **B6**: Average Tokens per Minute (from workbook summary)
- **B7**: PTU Conversion Rate (default: 50,000)
- **B8**: Desired PTUs for Fixed + Spillover Scenario

You can also edit PAYGO token prices for each model in the table below input cells.

## üß© Workbook ‚Üí Spreadsheet Mapping

| Workbook Panel                           | Spreadsheet Field                                      | Notes                                                                 |
|------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Token Summary & PTU Recommendation**   | B6 ‚Äì Average Tokens per Minute (Overall)               | Sum of Prompt + Completion tokens over time                          |
|                                          | B7 ‚Äì PTU Conversion Rate                               | Default is 50,000 TPM per PTU                                        |
|                                          | B8 ‚Äì Desired PTUs (for spillover scenario)             | You choose how much base PTU to reserve                              |
| **PTU Trend by Hour**                    | Supports peak PTU insights (shown in Excel‚Äôs Row 20+)  | Optional mapping; good for identifying spikes                        |
| **Rate Limit Errors Over Time**          | Context only ‚Äì no direct cell mapping                  | Helps determine if you‚Äôre hitting caps on PAYGO                      |

## üß™ Example Workflow

1. Run the Azure Workbook for the past **7 or 30 days**
2. Grab your average TPM from the **Token Summary** panel
3. Paste it into cell **B6** of the spreadsheet
4. Compare costs across full PTU, on-demand, and hybrid strategies

## üìä Spreadsheet Breakdown

### Assumptions & Inputs

- **B4 ‚Äì PTU Price per 1M Tokens (Reserved)**:
    - This is your negotiated or list price for PTUs.
    - You can find it in the [Azure Pricing Calculator](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/calculator/) or your EA pricing sheet.
    - Default value used: **$3 per 1M tokens** ‚Äî adjust if needed.

- **B5 ‚Äì Monthly Minutes**:
    - Default is **43,800** (30 days √ó 24 hours √ó 60 minutes).
    - If modeling for 7 days, use `7 * 24 * 60 = 10,080`.

- **B6 ‚Äì Average Tokens Per Minute**:
    - Get this from the Workbook: Token Summary panel shows total tokens used over time.
    - Use `Total Tokens √∑ Number of Minutes` to get the average TPM.

- **B7 ‚Äì PTU Conversion Rate**:
    - Default is **50,000 tokens/minute per PTU**.

- **B8 ‚Äì Desired PTUs for Fixed + Spillover**:
    - Choose a baseline PTU number to provision.
    - Useful if you want to combine fixed PTU with PAYGO for overflow.

### On-Demand Prices (Model-Specific)
- Edit the prices per 1M tokens for each model based on [Azure OpenAI pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/cognitive-services/openai-service/).

### PTU Calculation ‚Äì Average Usage (Rows 13‚Äì18)
- Shows average tokens per minute and required PTUs for each model.
- Total tokens per model = average TPM √ó 43,800.
- PTUs = `ceil(total_tokens / 50,000)`.

### PTU Calculation ‚Äì Peak Usage (Rows 20‚Äì24)
- Shows highest spike in tokens/min for each model.
- Use this to estimate buffer or detect overload risk.

### Scenario Analysis (Rows 27‚Äì31)
- Compares three strategies:
    - Full PTU only
    - PAYGO only
    - Fixed PTU + Spillover
- Helps find breakeven point based on your token consumption pattern.
